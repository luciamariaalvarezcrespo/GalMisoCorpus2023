## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it using https://github.com/luciamariaalvarezcrespo/GalMisoCorpus2023/security/advisories. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to fix the problem.

If the security vulnerability is accepted, a patch will be crafted in order to prepare a dedicated bugfix commit asap (depending on the complexity of the fix).
